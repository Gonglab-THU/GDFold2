# QA model
QA (Quality Assessment) model is trained to predict the ranking of quality for the structures generated by multiple GDFold2 folding events. This scoring model can reliably assist users in selecting high-quality structural models that are compatible with their predicted constraints.

## Usage
* `run.py`: takes a directory containing multiple protein structures (centroid model) generated by GDFold2 as input and output the ranking of quality for these structures.

### Running
Run `python run.py -h` for more detailed options.
```
usage: run.py [-h] [--input INPUT] [--model MODEL]

Protein Structure Quality Assessment

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --input INPUT  directory containing multiple structures generated by GDFold2
  --model MODEL  trained model, default=models/best.pth
```

Example:
```
python run.py --input example
